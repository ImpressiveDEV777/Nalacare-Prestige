Nala deodorants are free from aluminum, known carcinogens, parabens, phthalates, and propylene glycol, making them a safe choice during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

We encourage mothers who are conscious and curious about aluminum and its potential effects to consider switching to a natural deodorant as a great preventative and safe step in your (and your baby’s) self-care.

A note on essential oils:</span></p><ul data-pf-type="List" class="sc-pcLhl bMMcvF pf-5a6a6def" style="--text-indent:0; --line-spacing:10px;"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-oUnPI iVVzrr pf-f3827af1"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-a5715669">Lavender is sometimes listed as an essential oil that is not recommended during pregnancy. Specifically, this oil is Lavandula Latofolia, or Spanish lavender.
We do not use Spanish lavender in Nala products. <br>We do use Lavandula Anustifolia (English lavender) in our Peppermint & Charcoal Detox. The difference between these two is the much higher content (over 10%) of 1,8 cineole and camphor in Spanish lavender, which are excellent for respiratory issues, but not recommended for pregnant women and infants. English lavender has virtually no camphor (only 0.2%) and no 1,8 cineole. This is verified through quality testing and certification by our supplier, and our own rigorous quality standards. &nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-oUnPI iVVzrr pf-7af16435"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-0b645fe6">Peppermint is often used to relieve symptoms of nausea, indigestion, and fatigue - common side effects of pregnancy.

It is typically caused by the products of baking soda reacting with naturally occurring compounds in sweat, and typically subsides within a few days.
<br><br>
If you are experiencing a rash, take a break from your Nala deodorant for a few days or until the rash clears, then resume with a gentler solution, like our <a href="https://nalacare.myshopify.com/collections/free-from-deodorant/products/free-from-deodorant-detox-peppermint-charcoal" target="_self">Peppermint & Charcoal Detox</a> or any Sensitive Skin option in our <a href="https://nalacare.myshopify.com/products/personalized-nala-deodorant" target="_self">Personalized Deodorants</a>.<br>

<br>The Peppermint & Charcoal as well as our Sensitive Skin formulations are our most sensitive formula and contain no baking soda. The charcoal also supports the 'flushing out' phase by helping your body rid itself of toxins faster, due to its high absorbency properties. This can make your daytime deodorant more effective.
<br><br>
Additionally, you may be sensitive to specific essential oils, or baking soda in general. If this is the case, consider using just the Peppermint & Charcoal Detox every day.<br><br>

If you’ve given your pits a break and are still experiencing rashes, get in touch at <a href="mailto:sayhello@nalacare.com" target="_self">sayhello@nalacare.com</a> and we’ll guide you through this process, as well as other options for free-from deodorant.
<br><br>
For those that want to dig in on the science:
<br><br>
Baking soda, an ingredient in Sandalwood and Lemon Myrtle deodorants, reacts with the fatty acids and other odour-causing compounds present in our sweat, and neutralizes them by turning them into odourless salts. During the detoxification phase especially, or just in the switch to natural deodorant, you may experience some redness as these salts are produced in reaction with the baking soda. The good news is that your body will self-regulate its sweat production after a few weeks, and once your pits are flushed of toxins, this reaction usually disappears.
<br><br>

<br>What’s happening: Your pores are clearing/unclogging, and releasing toxins that have accumulated in your armpit.
<br>What to expect: Your body may sweat more than usual, and it’s even normal to smell a bit during this stage.
<br>How long it lasts: 1-2 weeks
<br>How to ride it out: Drink lots of water to assist with flushing out the toxins. Use the Detox deodorant at night to help remove toxins while you sleep, or right before you work out when you’ll be sweating a lot anyway.
<br><br>
Step 2: Adjustment
<br>What’s happening: Your armpit has shed ~50% of the toxic particles stored there, and is starting to function more naturally again.
<br>What to expect: Sweating and odour will start to subside (yay!).<br>
How long it lasts: 1-2 weeks. This is just the beginning of the regulation process, so keep using the Detox deodorant every night, while using a free-from deodorant during the day.
<br><br>
Step 3: Acclimatization
<br>What’s happening: Your armpits are well on their way to being free from toxins, and your body is acclimating to a new pattern of self-regulating sweat.
<br>What to expect: Odour will subside because the worst offenders (the conglomerated toxins that have been accumulating in your lymph nodes) will have been flushed out. You will sweat less – but you will still sweat. Sweat is a daily detoxification process that our body naturally regulates.
<br>How long it lasts: Ideally, this is a lifelong stage, &nbsp;as long as you don’t introduce the top offenders back into your pits.
<br>At this point, you can continue to use your detox deodorant until it runs out or simply use your free-from deodorant during the day. Some people find they don’t need the strength of baking soda in their everyday deodorant, and may continue using the Detox deodorant daily.</span></p></div></div><div class="sc-pJipy mZVAk pf-9ad1f43d accordion__item" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content.Wrapper"><button type="button" class="sc-pBlxj gYSgcm pf-9a1a21b0 pf-bg-lazy accordion__header pf-anchor" data-header-id="be9a1a21-b055-419a-91f4-3dde72aabf56" data-action="accordion2" data-preopen="false" data-active="false" data-pf-type="Accordion.Header"><i class="icon_position fa fa-plus"></i>Will I smell when switching to a free-from deodorant?</button><div class="sc-qYUWV exYsxy pf-55b19ad1 accordion__content" mode="view" data-id="be9a1a21-b055-419a-91f4-3dde72aabf56" data-pf-type="Accordion2.Content" style="display: none;"><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-d83320cb"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-a36dd833">In the early stages of switching to a free-from deodorant, it can be normal to smell a little more than usual.
